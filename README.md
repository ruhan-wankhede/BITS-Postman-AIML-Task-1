## Data Understanding & Feature Engineering

- **Dataset**: Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce website  
- **Customers**: 99,441 total with 96,096 unique customers  
- **Behavior**: only a few customers have multiple orders  
- **Churn rate**: ~60% of customers are churned  
- **Granularity**: used `customer_unique_id` instead of `customer_id` (since `customer_id` changes per session)  
- **Scaling**: I've used the standard scaler since one of the models is a regression models and the features vary greatly in scale (payment will be in thousands and frequency is 1-10 mostly)[this will be similar to if i applied log to the monetary_value feature before adding it to the features]

## Modeling

- **Logistic Regression** implemented in **PyTorch**  
- **Random Forest Classifier** implemented in **scikit-learn**  

### Data Leakage Issue
- Initially achieved **100% accuracy** â€” thought it was caused by leakage (which might've been one but not the primary reason):
  - `recency` and `churn` were computed **before splitting** the dataset.
- Fixed by changing the order:
  - Split customers first, then compute features and labels relative to the training reference date.  

### Insights
- **Including recency**: churn prediction becomes trivial giving near-perfect results, as the models just learn the rule `churn = (recency > 180)`.  
- **Excluding recency**: gives more realistic results:
  - Logistic Regression ~59% accuracy  
  - Random Forest ~51% accuracy  
- **Confusion matrix**: models often misclassify active customers as churned, shows class imbalance and difficulty of predicting churn without time-based signals.  

### Next Steps
- Engineer richer features (e.g., order frequency rate, average order value, time since first purchase).
- Try better tuning.
